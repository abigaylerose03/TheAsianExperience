<!-- What to include Title
Context (helpful background/theoretical framework—as such, secondary sources are required)
Significant questions (a line of inquiry)
Stakes (why this exploration matters)
Your engagement with at least 2 texts from this class
Along with your final multimodal project, you will be turning in a reflective write-up that discusses your experimenting process. In your essay (approx. 3 pages double spaced), you will write about how you created your project. How did you begin? What was your process like? What challenges arose? What do you want the audience to take away? What are you proud of? How does this project deepen our larger class exploration of these two major writers? What else would you want to add to the project? This is also akin to an “artist statement”. Feel free to include the above aspects (i.e. stakes, significant questions, etc.) in your write-up instead. -->

              <p><strong>Welcome to the The Asian-American Collective!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> The Asian-American Women Collective community-oriented website that aims to mobilize and visualize the empowerment of Asian-American women from a holistic sensory-based viewpoint</p>
              <p><strong>Signifcant questions:</strong> How can we create safe communities offline and online?
 Despite Asians having more than half the world's population, why are they portrayed so negatively in the media </p>
              <p><strong>Stakes:</strong>
This exploration matters because of the recurring negative portrayal of Asian women in American society. From persistent objectification to fetishnization in modern day media, my exploration proposes a solution to flip the script. Rather than reinforcing negative stereotypes, The Asian-American Women Collective celebrates our differences and bridges the cultural divisiveness people living in America perpetuate. </p>

Live Tinted started off as a digital community, where people from all different backgrounds and ethnicities came together to share their experiences with beauty. It was during that time she figured out what her first Live Tinted product would be: color-correcting crayons called Huesticks.
